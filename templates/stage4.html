<h1 style="text-align: center">Stage III</h1>
    <p>Patients with Stage III heart failure have been diagnosed with heart failure and have (currently) or had (previously) signs and symptoms of the condition.</p>

    <p>There are many possible symptoms of heart failure. The most common are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
    <li>Feeling tired (fatigue)</li>
    <li>Less able to exercise</li>
    <li>Weak legs</li>
    <li>Waking up to urinate</li>
    <li>Swollen feet, ankles, lower legs and abdomen (edema)</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Stage III treatment</h3>

    <p>The usual treatment plan for patients with Stage III includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Treatments listed in Stages I and II</li>
    <li>Beta-blocker (if you aren't taking one) to help your heart muscle pump stronger</li>
    <li>Aldosterone antagonist (if you aren't taking one) if a vasodilator medicine (ACE-I, ARB or angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor combination) and beta-blocker don't relieve your symptoms</li>
    <li>Hydralazine/nitrate combination if other treatments don't stop your symptoms. Patients who are African-American should take this medication (even if they are taking other vasodilator medications) if they have moderateÂ­ to-severe symptoms</li>
    <li>Medications that slow the heart rate if your heart rate is faster than 70 beats per minute and you still have symptoms</li>
    <li>Diuretic ("water pill") may be prescribed if symptoms continue</li>
    <li>Restrict sodium (salt) in your diet. Ask your doctor or nurse what your daily limit is</li>
    <li>Keep track of your weight every day. Tell your healthcare provider if you gain or lose more than 4 pounds from your "dry" weight</li>
    <li>Possible fluid restriction. Ask your doctor or nurse what your daily fluid limit is</li>
    <li>Possible cardiac resynchronization therapy (biventricular pacemaker)</li>
    <li>Possible implantable cardiac defibrillator (lCD) therapy</li>
    <li>If the treatment causes your symptoms to get better or stop, you still need to continue treatment to slow the progression to Stage IV</li>
</ul>

    <h1 style="text-align: center">Stage IV</h1>

    <p>Patients with Stage IV  have advanced symptoms that do not get better with treatment. This is the final stage of heart failure.</p>
    <h3>Stage IV treatment</h3>

    <p>The usual treatment plan for patients with Stage IV heart failure includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Treatments listed in Stages I, II and III</li>
        <li>Evaluation for more advanced treatment options, including:</li>
        <li>Heart transplant</li>
        <li>Ventricular assist devices</li>
        <li>Heart surgery</li>
        <li>Continuous infusion of intravenous inotropic drugs</li>
        <li>Palliative or hospice care</li>
        <li>Research therapies</li>
    </ul>
