    <p>Stage II is considered a pre-heart failure. It means you have been diagnosed with systolic left ventricular dysfunction
        but have never had symptoms of heart failure. Most people with Stage B heart failure have an echocardiogram (echo)
        that shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less. This category includes people who have heart failure and reduced EF
        (HFÂ­ rEF) due to any cause.</p>

    <h3>Stage II treatment</h3>
    <p>The usual treatment plan for patients with Stage II heart failure includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Treatments listed in Stage I</li>
        <li>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (if you aren't taking one as part of your Stage II treatment plan)</li>
        <li>Beta-blocker if you have had a heart attack and your EF is 40% or lower (if you aren't taking one as part of your Stage II treatment plan)</li>
        <li>Aldosterone antagonist if you have had a heart attack or if you have diabetes and an EF of 35% or less (to reduce the risk of your heart muscle getting bigger and pumping poorly)</li>
        <li>Possible surgery or intervention as a treatment for coronary artery blockage, heart attack, valve disease (you may need valve repair or replacement surgery) or congenital heart disease</li>
    </ul>
