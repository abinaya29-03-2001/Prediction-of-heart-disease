    <h3>Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels (atherosclerotic disease)</h3>
    <p>Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have
        chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of
        breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.</p>
    <p>Symptoms can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body
            are narrowed
        </li>
        <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You might not be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart
        failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor.
        Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular evaluations.</p>


    <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats (heart arrhythmias)</h3>
    <p>A heart arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart
        arrhythmia symptoms can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fluttering in your chest</li>
        <li>Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)</li>
        <li>Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)</li>
        <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Lightheadedness</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Fainting (syncope) or near fainting</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by heart defects</h3>
    <p>Serious congenital heart defects &mdash; defects you're born with &mdash; usually become evident soon after
        birth. Heart defect symptoms in children could include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis)</li>
        <li>Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes</li>
        <li>In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Signs
        and symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity</li>
        <li>Easily tiring during exercise or activity</li>
        <li>Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by weak heart muscle (dilated cardiomyopathy)</h3>
    <p>In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Breathlessness with exertion or at rest</li>
        <li>Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering</li>
        <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by heart infections</h3>
    <p>Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner membrane that separates the chambers and valves of the heart
        (endocardium). Heart infection symptoms can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Weakness or fatigue</li>
        <li>Swelling in your legs or abdomen</li>
        <li>Changes in your heart rhythm</li>
        <li>Dry or persistent cough</li>
        <li>Skin rashes or unusual spots</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by valvular heart disease</h3>
    <p>The heart has four valves &mdash; the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves &mdash; that open and close
        to direct blood flow through your heart. Valves may be damaged by a variety of conditions leading to narrowing
        (stenosis), leaking (regurgitation or insufficiency) or improper closing (prolapse).</p>
    <p>Depending on which valve isn't working properly, valvular heart disease symptoms generally include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
        <li>Swollen feet or ankles</li>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>Fainting (syncope)</li>
    </ul>
